# # TODO
# 
# - Try to get an end-to-end process going. Disregarding the JSON approach makes this easier, as there's no diffing for uploads, only downloads.
# 
# The steps:
# 
# - Document is written in .Rmd
# - The AST of the remote doc (at that version) is downloaded for diffing
# - A change is made to the google doc
# - The AST of the new doc is downloaded
# - The old and new ASTs are diffed
# - The diff is somehow passed to the original md
# - The diff is somehow passed to the original Rmd
# 
# For a first-step, enforce common-mark standards on the input Rmd.
# 
# The idea of diffing the remote ASTs is to preserve formatting which may not survive a round-trip, for example, formatting in-line or block code statements.

# TODO: Make all this run off the yaml

gdoc_pull <- function(file) {
  
  # If there have been changes (as per the Drive API, then investigate)
  
  # If the document AST is unchanged from the last pull, then do nothing
  
  # Try a simple find and replace for 'unknitting'
}


# Note: You need to init the document first, to set the title (I think)

  # Convert the file to commonmark standard
  convert_to_commonmark(file_name)

  if (is.null(yaml_vars$googdown$doc_id)) {
    
    # Upload the file as new (ideally you'd ensure that the file is saved at
    # this point...)
